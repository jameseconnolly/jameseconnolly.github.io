Additionally, an extensive stakeholder consultation process was conducted that included two rounds of dialogues involving close to one hundred participants.\"\n\nfor measures on the emission scopes: In preparing the NDC update, the scope of the coverage of the NDC has been extended to all categories of anthropogenic emissions in line with paragraph 31(c) by conducting a complete update of the historical energy and waste sectors emissions, as well as improvements in other sectors.\n\ninformation on the extent to which measures will be applied: Since ratification of the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016, Barbados has implemented the actions and activities specified in its NDC of 28 September 2015 needed to meet its conditional commitment. The implementation experience with the 2015 NDC has generally been positive:\n\nDecentralized solar PV installations have increased with over 2,000 independent power producers now generating 45 MW of power. Progress has also been made in deploying electric passenger vehicles and public buses (EVs).\n\nThe Sustainable Energy Investment Program (SMART FUND II), financed by an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan to the government and an investment grant from the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) provides financial and technical assistance for the preparation and retrofitting of at least 100 public buildings.\n\nThe Deployment of Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy project, financed by an IDB loan to the National Petroleum Corporation (NPC) and the Barbados National Oil Company Limited (BNOCL), supports the diversification of the energy mix, energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy and storage technology within the premises of the NPC and the BNOCL.\n\nImportantly, in 2020 the first Caribbean Green Climate Fund grant to the Barbados Water Authority (BWA) financed 6.5 MW in solar/gas microturbine capacity. The project is being implemented by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center (CCCCC) and will contribute to climate change adaptation in the water sector. The project involves a Revolving Adaptation Financing Facility to subsidize water efficiency measures for households, hotels and other businesses.\n\nIn 2019, the Fair Trading Commission established feed-in-tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy technologies up to 1 MW, and in 2020, established FITs for RE technologies up to 10 MW to replace a temporary tariff arrangement with the utility and provide stable and predictable price signals to potential investors.\n\nUntil 2018, the CHENACT project, initiated by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association and the IDB supported energy audits and efficiency measures in small and medium-sized hotels enabling savings of up to 50% of water usage and 30-50 % of energy bills.\n\nFinally, the government has made a number of policy interventions to further NDC implementation, such as the elimination in 2019 of customs duties on imported systems and equipment linked to renewable energy and the provision of several additional tax incentives.\n\nalso demonstration of mitigation ambitiion of 70% reduction in GHG emissions economy wide by 2030 will be complimented by:Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.\n\nA deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.\nhttps://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/WRI-ClimateWatch/ndc/blob/master/BRB-revised_first_ndc-EN.html\nhttps://blogs.iadb.org/sostenibilidad/en/barbados-demonstrates-climate-leadership-with-an-ambitious-updated-ndc/#:~:text=The%20Government%20of%20Barbados%20sets,economy%2Dwide%2C%20by%202030.\n\n\n",

Barbados will allow for the sale of up to 50% of any certified carbon credits generated between the period 2020 and 2030.\n\ncarbon removal mechanisms:\nPrivate finance initiatives and partnership options have specific merit.

The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2021, codified the Government of Canada’s commitment for the country to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nThis legislation requires the Government of Canada to set national emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals for 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045, and to develop emission reduction plans for each target as well as explain how each plan would contribute to reaching net-zero in 2050. The Government will engage key stakeholders and partners such as provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous Peoples, and the Net-Zero Advisory Body, among others, in setting these national targets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified that achieving net-zero emissions by about 2050 and achieving deeper near term emission reductions by 2030 are key to limiting warming to 1.5oC. Reducing Canada’s 2030 emissions by 40-45% below 2005 levels will help preserve the remaining carbon budget and act as an important milestone to 2050. Deep emissions reductions by 2030 are required in order to build the demand and supply for net-zero emissions technologies by 2050.\n\nThe independent Net-Zero Advisory Body, an expert advisory panel, is working to recommend pathways for Canada to reach its net-zero by 2050 target. The Advisory Body will also provide advice on emissions reductions milestones leading up to 2050, and identify near-term actions and key building blocks that support this long-term target.\n\nThe government is an important player in Canada’s work to reach to net-zero emissions by 2050. Government decisions must consider climate in a rigorous, consistent, and measurable manner. These considerations include both short and long-term climate mitigation, as well as climate resilience and adaptation. This transformation will require an aligned approach that ensures that government spending and decisions support Canada’s climate goals.\n\nCanada will continue to report on its progress through the UNFCCC National Communications every four years and National Inventory Reports every year. Canada will submit its final Biennial Report no later than December 31, 2022. Under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), Canada will submit its Biennial Transparency Report by December 31, 2024, and every two years thereafter, in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines (contained in 18/CMA.1) including on progress implementing and achieving its NDC. Furthermore, federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to jointly report on progress in implementing the PCF through annual PCF synthesis reports available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian- framework.html. The Government of Canada will also continue to report on projected emission reductions on an annual basis, and will continue to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples to design indicators that reflect Indigenous climate priorities. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act requires additional transparency measures including an emissions reduction plan, a progress report and an assessment report for each emissions reduction target it sets, as well as an annual report outlining how the Government of Canada is managing the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change.\n\nCanadas public plan for achieving its targets is outlined in the PCF \nfor example includes information like:\nCanada is a world leader in zero-carbon power, generating approximately 82% of its electricity from non-emitting sources, such as water, wind, solar and nuclear. Moving forward, emphasis will be placed on ensuring that Canada is prepared for the accelerated electrification of key sectors and can meet increased demand with new sources of non-emitting electricity.\n\nThe Government of Canada will:\n\nRequire 100 % of new light-duty vehicle and passenger trucks sold in Canada to be zero- emissions by 2035, a commitment supported by pursuing a combination of supportive investments and regulations.\n\nInvest $287 million to extend the Incentives for Zero-Emissions Vehicles program beyond its $300 million initial investment, and invest an additional $150 million in charging and refueling stations across Canada.\n\nWork with partners, domestically and internationally, to reduce emissions from other modes of transportation, which can be challenging to abate, including heavy-duty vehicles, rail, marine, and aviation operations.\n\nAdvance the national active transportation strategy by investing $400 million for Canada’s first active transportation fund, drawn from an investment of $14.9 billion for public and active transportation, which also includes $3 billion annually in permanent public transit funding beginning in 2026-27.\n\nWork with the United States to align with the most ambitious light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle standards whether at the state or federal level.\n\nInvest $964 million in smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects, as well as continue to work with provinces and territories to help build key intertie projects.\n\nCommit to powering rural, remote, northern and Indigenous communities that currently rely on diesel with clean, reliable energy by 2030.\n\nupdatesd NDC also outlines the importance of the Just transition and the need for inclusive measures that mitigate the impacts of climate change on underrepresented and marginalised groups\n\nmajor improvements in accountability as well: Canada is committed to reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

To restructure the national energy sector, energy governance to ensure the socio-economic sustainability is needed. Thus the social, economic, and environmental impacts must be assessed, and policies developed to meet regional needs. This means, of course, that the acceptance of renewable energies in society must be promoted through economic incentives such as new job opportunities, affordable electricity prices and accessible infrastructure. In addition, it is necessary and to limit damage to flora and fauna caused by renewable energy construction. The switch to cleaner energy sources will entail huge financial and administrative efforts to implement necessary technology, to adjust the existing energy infrastructure and to create institutions to help achieve emission reduction and energy efficiency. Efforts must be made on the national level as well as globally to achieve sustainable development in countries that are trying to balance resource rent dependencies, increasing energy demand, as well as achieving a national energy transition. Global energy policies could consider the needs of these countries and help improve, rather than worsen, already unequal power relations. Combating climate change should be the most important goal on the global agenda, meaning that new policy paths are required which prioritize international cooperation instead of international power struggles. The future should feature new approaches similar to the Yasuní-ITT initiative in Ecuador, which sought international payments for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, thus preserving biodiversity and globally important oxygen sources. Ecuador, like other countries dependent on fossil fuels or coal, must be supported in their quest for clean energy. Without international support, the nations’ access to a green future will be thwarted, aggravating climate change.\n",

Following the adaptation of the European CCS Directive in 2009, the legislative framework is ready. The use of BECCS will require an adequately centralized use of biomass (in fixed facilities and therefore excluding transport), whereas bio-energy generally is more often used in small facilities in a more scattered way. Rolling out these technologies will benefit from proper integration with the regions’ economies, ideally reusing existing infrastructure and underground storage, offshore if necessary.\nUncertainties regarding these technologies, their acceptability and the availability and reliability of storage mean that their development must be carefully considered and based on the definition of a viable economic model combined with good long-term risk management. That being said, it is most likely that it is an essential option for the future, as it allows for the generation of continuous negative emissions over the very long term (with forest storage eventually reaching an optimum level, draining carbon sinks in a few decades/centuries). Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also an option, but it is still in the very early stages of research and development.",

In 2017, an estimated 28 million tonnes of CO2 and other carbon gases were removed by vegetation in the UK3. Such removals are included and netted off against the UK’s GHG emissions in the Climate Change Act definition of how GHG emissions are measured.\nHowever, potential GHG emissions from some areas of the UK’s natural environment that are not in good condition are currently excluded from the definition. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) have reported estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from peatland in the UK as 23 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year4\"\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24\n\nSeparate biodiversity plans but not integrated in Carbon Credit Conditions",

    "interim_target_text": "Our intended contributions are presented below.\nForestry i) Unconditional contributions\nGuyana is willing to continue making the following contributions unconditionally:\n7\nContinue and improve ongoing work to realize sustainable forest management. GFC\nwill ensure compliance with the various Codes of Practice that govern the timber\nindustry using local resources.\nForest monitoring will maintain a high level of timber legality, with the GFC\ncommitting 50% of its staff to field monitoring from its 54 forest monitoring stations\ncountrywide. These efforts will maintain a low rate of illegal logging (at less than 2% of\nproduction).\nGuyana is also prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership\nAgreement (VPA) under EU- FLEGT. The VPA is expected to be finalized in 2016 and to\nprovide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices\nthroughout Guyana‟s timber industry.\nWe are prepared to improve added- value activities locally to assist in creating a\nhigher potential for carbon storage in long-use wood products. This could also\npotentially reduce the pressure on forest resources as derivation of a higher value\nmay result in reduced harvest levels.\nIndigenous people own and manage some 14% of Guyana‟s lands. The culture and\ntraditions of Guyana‟s indigenous peoples are rooted in sustainable use of nature,\nevident in the forests and other natural ecosystems maintained through centuries on\nthe lands they have customarily occupied and used. Guyana will strengthen its\nsupport for indigenous communities as they continue the stewardship of their lands\nand inter alia the benefits that accrue from any REDD+ activities from these lands.\nIf they choose to, communities will be supported to better manage their transition to\nmore market-based means of provisioning for their social and cultural well-being in\nways that continue the tradition of wise use. Indigenous peoples themselves, through\nthe full application of the FPIC process, in keeping with the stated policy in the\nLCDS, will decide whether or not to include their titled lands as part of Guyana‟s\nREDD+ programme. Policies will also be implemented to reflect equity between the\nextractive sector and indigenous peoples as the nation moves to genuinely ensure\nthat the fight against climate change continues.\nii) Conditional Contributions\nAvoided Deforestation\nGuyana‟s proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined\nReference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as\nconcluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana‟s historic emissions level\nfor the period 2000 to 2009 (0.06%) as established in the GNA. Using a total carbon\nstock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 tCO2e,\nGuyana‟s Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7 MtCO2e. Through\nthis approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 MtCO2e\nannually if adequate incentives are provided.\n8\nTo contribute to avoided deforestation and achieve an effective REDD+ programme,\nGuyana will implement policies measures, and incentive programmes, to engender\nbroader participation of civil society and the private sector in actions to avoid\ndeforestation and forest degradation. The Guyana Government is cognizant of the need\nfor comprehensive land use planning in order to efficiently management and rationally\nexploit our national resources.\nIn summary, avoided emissions contributions resulting from reforms in the timber and\nmining industries can contribute up to 48.7 MtCO2e to the global mitigation effort\nthrough the implementation of the Emission Reduction Programme described in greater\ndetail below.\nEmission Reduction Programme for Forests\nGiven that the bulk of Guyana‟s emissions emanate from mining and logging activities,\nour Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP) will therefore focus on making these\nindustries more efficient and compliant with our targets. With adequate resources,\nGuyana will develop a suite of ERP measures that will include:\n- the conservation of an additional 2 million hectares through Guyana‟s\nNational Protected Area System and other effective area -based conservation\nmeasures as per Guyana‟s commitment under the UNCBD, including the\nprotection of conservancies and reservoirs and their watersheds and the\nwatersheds upstream of new hydro-power sites. Existing mangrove forests\nwill be counted in this target and the mangrove restoration programme along\nthe vulnerable coast will be expanded.\nTimber harvesting contributed 40% of Guyana‟s emissions from land use between\n2001 and 2012. In the timber industry the ERP will:\n• Use of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and\ncollateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid\ntrails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the\nannual emissions by 13.5%. This translates to a reduction of about 430,000\ntCO2 per year.\nThis will result in a reduction of the annual emissions from the timber industry\nfrom 3.5M tCO2 to 2.3M tCO2, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this\ndriver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level.\n• Guyana is in the process of reviewing compliance of significant timber\nconcession agreements with a view to determining if they meet agreed targets. \n9\nA wider review to determine the most optimal use of these lands will be\nundertaken. If, in fact, REDD+ can provide adequate incentives, Guyana would\nbe prepared to reduce the area to be logged in favour of conservation\nconcessions and to further the development of non-timber forest products and\nother forest-based services while recognizing the need for livelihoods.\nOur MRVS has verified that small scale gold mining resulted in 89% of the deforestation\nrecorded in Guyana over the past three years. To address this, the ERP will include\nactions by the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) to implement policy\nreforms, education, and incentives for integrated planning and management of the\nmining sector. This will support the transformation of the mining sector by 2020 and\ninclude actions to:\n• Implement mineral mapping in the mining districts to identify\neconomically exploitable deposits. This will significantly reduce deforestation\nby avoiding clearing of forest cover from lands which contain only marginal\nmineral deposits. A significant portion of Guyana‟s deforestation results from\nforest clearing for mining that does not generate a profit.\n• Implement awareness and incentive programmes to improve the\nefficiency of technologies and practices in the mining industry. This will\ninclude replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient\ntechnologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase\ngold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause\nminers to often return to previously mined areas when technology or\neconomic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency\nwould make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate costeffective reforestation and recovery of mined sites.\n• Implement policies to institute mandatory, nation-wide land\nreclamation and reforestation of mined areas.\n\nForest Governance\nGuyana has made significant progress in complying with EU-FLEGT for our timber\nexports to the European Union. Additional resources are required to build institutional\nand private sector capacity to meet other trade and supply conditions such as the Lacey\nAct, FSC certification and other procurement requirements.\nMRVS\nA comprehensive and robust MRV system, one of the most advanced of its kind, has\nbeen developed under Guyana‟s REDD+ programme. The development of this system\nhas contributed considerably to the global understanding of how small forested tropical\ncountries can reliably and cost-effectively measure and report on its forest carbon \n10\nemissions. Guyana is willing to build on the lessons learnt thus far to complete and\nmaintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided to do so.\nImplementation cost\nThe cost of implementation of these forest-conservation initiatives in total is estimated\nto be determined annually.\nEnergy\nUnconditional Contributions\nGuyana is in the process of reviewing our options toward the rapid expansion of a\nrenewable energy supply. Our goal is to develop a mix of wind, solar, biomass and\nhydropower to supply both the demand of the national grid and the energy\nrequirements for towns and villages in Guyana‟s hinterland.\nGuyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems\nat suitable locations such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari. Guyana will power all\nof the six newly established townships, starting with Bartica, using renewable energy\nsources. Currently, Guyana has installed cogeneration from bagasse to power sugar\nmills. Independent power producers and suppliers are being encouraged to construct\nenergy farms and sell energy to the national grid. Preliminary approvals have been given\nfor a 26MW wind farm.\nThe Government of Guyana will continue to work closely with farmers in agricultural\nareas across Guyana to encourage the use of bio-digesters to reduce waste, produce\nbiogas and provide affordable, healthy and efficient cooking means at the household\nlevel.\nLegislation has been enacted to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation\nof renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to\nincentivize and motivate energy efficient behavior. Guyana will continue to conduct\nenergy audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, residential and commercial\nbuildings to reduce energy consumption. Public education and awareness programmes\nwill continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools to\nreduce energy consumption and expenditure. Guyana will implement other policies to\nencourage energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, including building codes\nand net-metering of residential renewable power.\nWe expect that these unconditional contributions will significantly reduce Guyana‟s\nenergy consumption.\nConditional Contributions\nGuyana is committed to eliminating our near complete dependence on fossil fuels.\nGiven our solar, wind and hydropower potential and relatively small national demand, \n11\nwe believe that with adequate and timely financial support, Guyana can develop a 100%\nrenewable power supply by 2025. Assessment of the potential of the renewable power\nsources will be undertaken to determine the most cost effective and efficient means of\ndeveloping this potential; to this end an independent review of the Amaila Falls Project\nis to be undertaken with the assistance of the Kingdom of Norway.",

This includes State and Regional development plans and policies under the guidance of the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (2018-2030) which is aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In addition, the National Environmental Policy (2019), Myanmar Climate Change Policy (2019), Myanmar Climate Change Strategy (2018-2030), and Myanmar Climate Change Master Plan (2018-2030) were endorsed in 2019.

Actions in the forestry sector will preserve a GHG sink.\nhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Myanmar%20First/Myanmar's%20INDC.pdf\n\n\nCredits: The NDC implementation plan will include an assessment of both the conditional and unconditional targets set in this NDC, the necessary enabling environment, the key stakeholders to be consulted in the development of such plans as well as human, technical, and financial resources. It will explore the various pathways in which the NDC targets can be achieved, including an assessment of any market mechanisms that can be deployed to support the country. Sinks and separate emissions removal target: In the Agriculture sector, Myanmar has introduced a new conditional cumulative target of sequestrating 10.4 million tCO2e over the period of 2021-2030. Through promotion of tree planting and agroforestry Myanmar will raise the average tree canopy cover across 275,000 ha of its agricultural land with <10% tree canopy cover per hectare.\nhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Myanmar%20First/Myanmar%20Updated%20%20NDC%20July%202021.pdf",

The implementation of these measures would mean an introduction of about 47% renewable energy in the national electricity system. Thus, Sao Tome and Principe would be able to reduce greenhouse gases by about 57 ktCO2eq, which approximately corresponds to a 24% national emission reduction by 2030 related to 2005.\n\nThe country elaborated a proposal for a monitoring and progress report.\n\nEquity: The country is an absolute sink of greenhouse gases (contributes to the sequestration of CO2) and is one of the countries most affected by climate change. Sao Tome and Principe is willing to make efforts to reduce emissions depending on support it may receive from the international community.\nhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Sao%20Tome%20and%20Principe%20First/STP_INDC%20_Ingles_30.09.pdf\n\nGovernance: Building off the national and sectoral plans and comprehensive consultations, in 2018, the country elaborated, with support from the NDC Partnership, a NDC Implementation Plan to drive mitigation, adaptation and crosscutting components of its NDC. The NDC Implementation Plan serves as a planning, coordination, transparency, and resource mobilization tool for the Government and is being implemented with support from national and international stakeholders. Equity: Equity and Ambition – The evolution of STP’s emissions is insignificant in comparison to global emissions and in terms of net emissions, as of 2012, it continues as a net CO2 sink country. Nevertheless, STP is ready to make efforts towards the reduction of additional emissions, as it receives financial, and technological resources as well as capacity strengthening support. The evolution of STP’s emissions is insignificant in comparison to global emissions and, in terms of net 2012 emissions, continues to be a net CO2 sink country. Thus, in practical terms, its historic and current contributions towards global emissions is already neutral.",

There is CO2 absorption in forests.

In the medium and long term, it intends to plan and use the carbon market or new market mechanisms. STP supports the use of market mechanisms, including the pre-2020 mitigation results",

Togo implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the energy, agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. \n\nIn terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in Togo by 20% over the course of the period under review, by improving the road system, promoting the use of public transport, reducing the average age of imported vehicles (to 5-7 years) and promoting active modes of transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths).\n\nEquity:\nTogo is a small country that emits almost no GHGs and so has virtually no responsibility in terms of global warming. Through its INDC, Togo proposes to focus on carbon-lean sustainable development, by encouraging sustainable practices, whereas the easy solution would simply be to continue using fossil fuels while they are still available.\nAccording to the IPCC, the estimated worldwide GHG emissions for 2010 totalled roughly 40,000 Mt of CO2e.

It is worth noting, with concern, that the majority of reported financial climate support has not been in the form of grants, but mostly in the form of loans.

The government's Low Emissions Technology Statement specifies the government's technology investment priorities and supports gas and CCS. \n\nThe ERF allows the government to purchase low-cost abatement (Ausrtalian carbon credit units) to provide incentives to business and households to reduce their emissions. \n\nEnhancing carbon levels in soils offers huge potential to improve the uptake of carbon emissions across the globe. Australia is a world leader in this area and will be sharing its expertise with other countries. - https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/Summary%20Report%20Australias%202030%20Emission%20Reduction%20Target.pdf\n\nIn the updated NDC report- Carbon capture and storage – CO2 compression, hub transport and storage under $20/t of CO2 as well as soil carbon measurements under $3/ha/year\n\"Carbon capture and storage: The $20 per tonne of CO₂ stretch goal covers CO2 compression, hub transport and storage, but does not cover capture processes, noting the cost of capture technologies varies between applications and depends on factors such as the relative concentration of CO2 for different industrial processes. The stretch goal assumes CO₂ is transported within a hub distance of less than 100 km to suitable reservoirs. Achieving a stretch goal of under $20 per tonne would position CCS to be competitive over the long term with other forms of abatement supported by Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. Under a high technology scenario, CCS could be deployed as early as 2025, subject to securing offtake agreements and development approvals.\"\n\nsoil carbon- \"Soil carbon measurement: The soil carbon measurement stretch goal time range was set based on consultations with industry. Based on a high technology uptake scenario, advancements in proximal sensing, simulation modelling and remote sensing technologies could see the stretch goal of under $3 per hectare per year reached as early as 2025. As of 2020, soil carbon measurement for Emissions Reduction Fund projects were estimated at around $30 per hectare per year (CSIRO estimates based on a land area of 300 hectares; estimates could be lower for larger areas).\"\n\n\"Achievement of Australia’s priority technology stretch goals will have a significant impact on global emissions. The five technologies first identified in Australia’s first low emissions technology statement (2020) (hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions materials, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement) address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually. Australia is targeting international partnerships that support these economic stretch goals, including access to global markets and more competitive supply chains. We are also prioritising partnerships that focus on critical research, development and deployment challenges for economically important, hard-to-abate sectors.\" \n\nso as mentioned above, there is a strong emphasis on technology stretch goals to have an impact on global emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalso discusses offsets and sinks in terms of Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive manner; The five yearly review process will allow Australia to take stock of our progress towards our net zero target. This will ensure our policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international developments and other factors. It will ensure there is transparency regarding how progress is tracked, including any updates or revisions, achievements and effectiveness of key national policies and investments, as well as the role of state and territory policies and targets in contributing to the national goal. It will enable Australia to balance its investments across domestic offsets, international offsets and pursuing technological breakthroughs).\n\n\n\n",

Electricity - 33% reduction \n2. Oil and gas - 65%\n3. Transport - 7%\nThe key for Egypt to mitigate GHGs emissions is to provide appropriate foundations for\nthe development of low carbon energy systems.\nPathways to achieving high CO2 mitigation levels comprise the following:\n Widespread diffusion of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy production\ntechnologies, with substantial reductions in energy intensity\n Comprehensive mitigation efforts covering all major sources of emissions\n Locally-appropriate technology transfer and financial flows from industrialized\ncountries (Annex I countries) to support carbon emission abatement according\nto the UNFCCC principles, which acknowledges that developed countries should\nprovide required support to developing countries in this regard.\nPolicies targeting development that is more sustainable rely upon five main pillars:\n1. More efficient use of energy, especially by end users;\n2. Increased use of renewable energy as an alternative to non-renewable energy\nsources;\n3. Use of advanced locally-appropriate and more-efficient fossil fuel technologies,\nwhich is less-emitting, in addition to new generations of nuclear power;\n4. Energy efficiency is the cornerstone to be targeted by policy makers to decouple\ndemand on energy and economic growth; and\n5. Reform energy subsidies. This policy is implemented using four pillars, namely:\nset different prices for petroleum products based on energy generation\nefficiency; increase the efficiency of energy use; provide support to certain\nsectors to promote switching from conventional energy sources to clean energy\nsources; and apply the fuel subsidy smartcard system to ensure that subsidies\nare received by target beneficiaries.\nThe degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one\nof the main distinguishing characteristics of greenhouse gas reduction pathways.\nEnergy efficiency could be improved radically through a combination of behavioral\nchanges and rapid introduction of stringent efficiency regulations, technology\nstandards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.\nRenewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very\nimportant role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate\nchange manageable. However, renewable energy may provide a number of\nopportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development,\nenergy access, secure energy supply, and reduced local environmental and health\nimpacts.

The observation of the impacts of extreme weather events on Georgia’s population, induced by the climate change during the last decades, reveals the vulnerable groups requiring urgent adaptation measures: children and adolescents, women, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, persons with chronic diseases, and eco-migrants displaced as a result of disasters caused by climate change or those who are threatened to be eco migrated due to the climate change.\n\nFor implementation of the climate change policy, Georgia is committed to operate the governmental Climate Change Council established by the decree #54 of the Government of Georgia dated January 2020.",

It will lead to an overall increase in green jobs such as in renewable energy, clean energy industries- in automotives, manufacturing of low emissions products like Electric Vehicles and super-efficient appliances, and innovative technologies such as green hydrogen, etc. India’s updated NDC will be implemented over the period 2021-2030 through programs and schemes of relevant Ministries /departments and with due support from States and Union Territories. The Government has launched many schemes and programs to scale up India’s actions on both adaptation and mitigation. Appropriate measures are being taken under these schemes and programs across many sectors, including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainable mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy and resource efficiency, etc. As a result of the aforesaid measures, India has progressively continued decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. The Net Zero target by 2030 by Indian Railways alone will lead to a reduction of emissions by 60 million tonnes annually. Similarly, India’s massive LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually.\n\nIndia's climate actions have so far been largely financed from domestic resources. However, providing new and additional financial resources as well as transfer of technology to address the global climate change challenge are among the commitments and responsibilities of the developed countries under UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. India will also require its due share from such international financial resources and technological support.\"",

Most noteworthy is Government Decision 171 passed on the 25th of July 2021 entitled \"Transition to a Low Carbon Economy.”\nUnlike Israel's original NDC, this new Decision includes an unconditional absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal for 2030 of 27% relative to 2015 and an unconditional absolute GHG emissions reduction goal for 2050 of 85% relative to 2015. \nWhereas our INDC submitted in 2015 projected 2030 emissions would be 81.65 MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to be 58 MtCO2e by 2030.\nThis updated goal significantly improves upon Israel's first NDC which was presented as a per capita economy-wide unconditional GHG reduction. The previous target was 7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which corresponded to a total of 81.6 MtCO2e. The updated target presented in this NDC is 58 MtCO2e, which corresponds to a reduction of 23 MtCO2e or 29% in Israel' s total emissions. \nWe believe that this updated NDC is a marked improvement both in the process by which the 2030 and 2050 national and sectoral goals were determined; in the more ambitious mitigation goal and in the work carried out to increase preparedness and adaptation to Climate Change.\n\n\nhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/Pages/Party.aspx?party=ISR&prototype=1",

According to the International Energy Association, Nigeria emitted 104.27 MtCO2e in 2018. 2018 MtCO2e levels represents an increase of 271.6% from 1990 levels.  Between 2010 and 2018, Nigeria’s GHG emissions increased by 40% to reach 347 MtCO2eq. The baseline projection has been updated too, estimating GHG emissions at 453 MtCO2eq by 2030, i.e. around half the 2015 estimates and a 31% increase in total GHG emissions between 2018 and 2030 (+2.6%/year). \n\nOf Nigeria’s total GHG emissions in 2016 (481.02 MtCO2e), the majority of its composition is comprised of carbon dioxide at 61.74%, followed by methane at 27.82%, nitrous oxide at 7.77%, and fluorinated gas at 2.66%.\nhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Nigeria%20First/NDC%20INTERIM%20REPORT%20SUBMISSION%20-%20NIGERIA.pdf",

By increasing the share of solar, wind, hydro and biomass, South Sudan aims at achieving cumulative emission reduction of 69 percent by 2030 compared to the baseline.
