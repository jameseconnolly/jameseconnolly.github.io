                    <p>Net-zero targets are often a central part of national policy to negate global warming and subsequently limit global temperatures to 1.5˚C. By balancing greenhouse gas emissions with the amount removed from the atmosphere through carbon removal and sequestration, you have achieved Net-zero. This project will provide a background for the need of Net-zero Targets, whilst uncovering the lack of transparency and various misconceptions embedded within current national targets. I will then address the subsequent impact of "in-sufficient" targets.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 30 years, we’ve seen a substantial rise in CO₂ emissions, especially in parts of Asia and Africa. To highlight this, I obtained data from the EIA’s API. Each countries data was stored in an individual API, so I looped over a list of country codes I scraped from a table on IBAN’s website, which I then combined into a singular dataframe. The API only included country codes, so I imported pycountry on Python to match the Alpha-3 codes to the names. I then manually changed various country names to match those in the topojson to ensure no data was lost. Yearly data was stored under a ‘data’ field, so I added the data in an array. China’s CO₂ emissions are substantially higher than other countries, so I used a mid-domain scale in Vega-lite to balance the maps colours.</p>
                    <p>Countries Net-zero Target’s often vary. Many countries have ambitious targets (2030), but no carbon sequestration plans or reporting mechanisms, and many targets are only pledges. I used a REST API from Net Zero Tracker to gather this data. I again matched country names to those in the topojson. I had to call a significant number of API’s, so in the case of an error, a message would be printed. Most countries have some form of target, which varies in its mechanism. However side-by-side, the maps highlight the growth of emissions in countries like India and China, which worryingly have distant targets.</p>

                <p>Carbon capture and storage is essential to reaching net-zero, however we’ve seen that many countries have no removal strategy. Chart 3 depicts the need for CCS, especially in countries with greater GHG emissions. Many smaller countries have little CCS development and subsequently a greater need to deploy it, given the cost barrier and technology of direct air capture. Countries can plant trees, however it’s land intensive and not an overarching solution. I imported linregress within Python, to calculate the regression line. CCS data only existed within an online map, so I manually typed a csv to gather the data. I imported math into Python to log GHG, to compress the y-axis.</p>

                <p>The level of environmental protection spending as detailed within target plans can often vary. To highlight this, I used protection spending from an IMF’s API. Although all the necessary data was within a single-API call, the relevant data was within an ‘attributes’ field which was within a ‘features’ field. I therefore had to loop through the features and extract the 'attributes' field from each feature, which was appended. The IMF and tracker data were in different orders, so I merged on ISO3 values.</p>
                <iframe style="border:0" class="chart" src="achart4_GHG_Spending.html" width="615" height="570" ></iframe>
                <p>The legal status of targets is often overlooked and subsequently dictates the sufficiency of targets. Countries with no or proposed targets emit less, suggesting their smaller and/or LDC’s. I grouped the API data together by legal status and calculated a mean of GHG emissions and target year to match the bar-chart format. To make the no-target data visible, I coded the target year as 3000, which I then removed in the vega-lite specification.</p>
                <iframe style="border:0" class="chart" src="achart5_CO2_Target_Status.html" width="505" height="485" ></iframe>
                <p>I performed Principal Component Analysis to analyse whether the GHG emissions and carbon capture requirement of a country can identify the Net-zero Target year. Countries with 2000/2030 targets and 2045/2050 are clustered closely together, suggesting closely timed targets are correlated as expected. This data was taken from my tracker API.</p>
                <iframe style="border:0" class="chart" src="achart6_PCA.html" width="535" height="415" ></iframe>
                <p>If current policies lack transparency or detailed plans, how will this effect future GHG emissions? I used csv data taken from the climate action tracker, given that API projection data is not available. I converted my data into a dictionary, then into a list of its values and then wrote the string of that list to a file in JSON format. Chart 7 highlights the need to strengthen targets and even change many 2050 targets to 2030, if we wish to meet the 1.5˚C target.</p>

                <p>It’s clear that there are many elements which dictate the sufficiency of a net-zero target. Many rapidly expanding economies have distant targets, with an increasing need for CCS technology and greater environmental protection spending. If the technology to meet net-zero through sequestration is currently not available or too expensive, countries should not use these targets on the bet that a carbon capture process with save the day in the future.</p>
