Complementary to the conditional contribution, Barbados makes an unconditional contribution for the electricity sector of an emissions reduction of 50% by 2030.""

in terms of consumption: Barbados’ updated conditional mitigation contribution for 2030 consists of:
A 95% share of renewable energy in the electricity mix
100% electric or alternatively-fueled vehicles in the passenger fleet
A 20% increase in energy efficiency across all sectors as compared to BAU.
A 29% decrease in industrial, commercial and residential fuel consumption as compared to BAU
A 20% decrease in waste emissions

previous emissions inclusion: This new 2021 NDC update GHGI was used as the basis of the emissions and removals projections to 2030 which were also significantly updated from the previous included in the 2015 NDC. The sources of GHG emissions data are:
GHG Inventory 2000-2010 prepared by the Ministry of Environment and National Beautification (MENB).
2015 NDC spreadsheets.
Updated activity data information for the period 2011-2020, including: i) energy balances 2008-2020 prepared by Ministry of Energy; ii) residues deposited in landfills; iii) updated GDP and population; iv) waste stream data 2010-2020 prepared by Sanitation Service Authority; v) other information.

The entire process was led by the Ministry of Environment and National Beautification, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and Investments, and the Ministry of Energy to ensure alignment with national priorities and effective implementation. Additionally, an extensive stakeholder consultation process was conducted that included two rounds of dialogues involving close to one hundred participants.""

for measures on the emission scopes: In preparing the NDC update, the scope of the coverage of the NDC has been extended to all categories of anthropogenic emissions in line with paragraph 31(c) by conducting a complete update of the historical energy and waste sectors emissions, as well as improvements in other sectors.

information on the extent to which measures will be applied: Since ratification of the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016, Barbados has implemented the actions and activities specified in its NDC of 28 September 2015 needed to meet its conditional commitment. The implementation experience with the 2015 NDC has generally been positive:

Decentralized solar PV installations have increased with over 2,000 independent power producers now generating 45 MW of power. Progress has also been made in deploying electric passenger vehicles and public buses (EVs).

The Sustainable Energy Investment Program (SMART FUND II), financed by an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan to the government and an investment grant from the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) provides financial and technical assistance for the preparation and retrofitting of at least 100 public buildings.

The Deployment of Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy project, financed by an IDB loan to the National Petroleum Corporation (NPC) and the Barbados National Oil Company Limited (BNOCL), supports the diversification of the energy mix, energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy and storage technology within the premises of the NPC and the BNOCL.

Importantly, in 2020 the first Caribbean Green Climate Fund grant to the Barbados Water Authority (BWA) financed 6.5 MW in solar/gas microturbine capacity. The project is being implemented by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center (CCCCC) and will contribute to climate change adaptation in the water sector. The project involves a Revolving Adaptation Financing Facility to subsidize water efficiency measures for households, hotels and other businesses.

In 2019, the Fair Trading Commission established feed-in-tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy technologies up to 1 MW, and in 2020, established FITs for RE technologies up to 10 MW to replace a temporary tariff arrangement with the utility and provide stable and predictable price signals to potential investors.

Until 2018, the CHENACT project, initiated by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association and the IDB supported energy audits and efficiency measures in small and medium-sized hotels enabling savings of up to 50% of water usage and 30-50 % of energy bills.

Finally, the government has made a number of policy interventions to further NDC implementation, such as the elimination in 2019 of customs duties on imported systems and equipment linked to renewable energy and the provision of several additional tax incentives.

also demonstration of mitigation ambitiion of 70% reduction in GHG emissions economy wide by 2030 will be complimented by:Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.

A deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.

The aggregation of GHG emissions has been estimated using the 100-year time-horizon global warming potential values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

The Government of Barbados will put forward legislation that specifies that all emission reduction or removal units (carbon credits) belong to the Crown, unless otherwise specified. Barbados will allow for the sale of up to 50% of any certified carbon credits generated between the period 2020 and 2030.

carbon removal mechanisms:
Private finance initiatives and partnership options have specific merit. Barbados has been promoting and engaging in the areas of:

Green and blue bonds. The first private green bond was issued in August 2019 by Williams Caribbean Capital (WCC). This BBD 3 million (USD 1.5 million) bond finances solar PV assets.

Debt for Nature Swaps, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes;

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021d). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 427-467 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded.
https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/targets/

","Canada moved last year to set a 2050 net-zero target. The nation had already committed to cut emissions by 30% by 2030, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has today announced that 40-45% will now be the goal. Canada is using a 2005 baseline.

for historical emissions- whilst not specifically included in the target, the updated NDC claims that ""Canada continually looks for ways to improve its methodologies to account for historical emissions. Adopting future methodological improvements may affect historical emissions, including 2005 emissions. This could indirectly affect the megatonnes of emissions reductions required for Canada to achieve its 2030 target.

The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2021, codified the Government of Canada’s commitment for the country to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

This legislation requires the Government of Canada to set national emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals for 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045, and to develop emission reduction plans for each target as well as explain how each plan would contribute to reaching net-zero in 2050. The Government will engage key stakeholders and partners such as provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous Peoples, and the Net-Zero Advisory Body, among others, in setting these national targets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified that achieving net-zero emissions by about 2050 and achieving deeper near term emission reductions by 2030 are key to limiting warming to 1.5oC. Reducing Canada’s 2030 emissions by 40-45% below 2005 levels will help preserve the remaining carbon budget and act as an important milestone to 2050. Deep emissions reductions by 2030 are required in order to build the demand and supply for net-zero emissions technologies by 2050.

The independent Net-Zero Advisory Body, an expert advisory panel, is working to recommend pathways for Canada to reach its net-zero by 2050 target. The Advisory Body will also provide advice on emissions reductions milestones leading up to 2050, and identify near-term actions and key building blocks that support this long-term target.

The government is an important player in Canada’s work to reach to net-zero emissions by 2050. Government decisions must consider climate in a rigorous, consistent, and measurable manner. These considerations include both short and long-term climate mitigation, as well as climate resilience and adaptation. This transformation will require an aligned approach that ensures that government spending and decisions support Canada’s climate goals.

Canada will continue to report on its progress through the UNFCCC National Communications every four years and National Inventory Reports every year. Canada will submit its final Biennial Report no later than December 31, 2022. Under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), Canada will submit its Biennial Transparency Report by December 31, 2024, and every two years thereafter, in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines (contained in 18/CMA.1) including on progress implementing and achieving its NDC. Furthermore, federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to jointly report on progress in implementing the PCF through annual PCF synthesis reports available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian- framework.html. The Government of Canada will also continue to report on projected emission reductions on an annual basis, and will continue to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples to design indicators that reflect Indigenous climate priorities. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act requires additional transparency measures including an emissions reduction plan, a progress report and an assessment report for each emissions reduction target it sets, as well as an annual report outlining how the Government of Canada is managing the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change.

Canadas public plan for achieving its targets is outlined in the PCF 
for example includes information like:
Canada is a world leader in zero-carbon power, generating approximately 82% of its electricity from non-emitting sources, such as water, wind, solar and nuclear. Moving forward, emphasis will be placed on ensuring that Canada is prepared for the accelerated electrification of key sectors and can meet increased demand with new sources of non-emitting electricity.

The Government of Canada will:

Require 100 % of new light-duty vehicle and passenger trucks sold in Canada to be zero- emissions by 2035, a commitment supported by pursuing a combination of supportive investments and regulations.

Invest $287 million to extend the Incentives for Zero-Emissions Vehicles program beyond its $300 million initial investment, and invest an additional $150 million in charging and refueling stations across Canada.

Work with partners, domestically and internationally, to reduce emissions from other modes of transportation, which can be challenging to abate, including heavy-duty vehicles, rail, marine, and aviation operations.

Advance the national active transportation strategy by investing $400 million for Canada’s first active transportation fund, drawn from an investment of $14.9 billion for public and active transportation, which also includes $3 billion annually in permanent public transit funding beginning in 2026-27.

Work with the United States to align with the most ambitious light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle standards whether at the state or federal level.

Invest $964 million in smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects, as well as continue to work with provinces and territories to help build key intertie projects.

Commit to powering rural, remote, northern and Indigenous communities that currently rely on diesel with clean, reliable energy by 2030.

Total installed capacity of wind and solar power to reach 1200 GW by 2030

","In Sept 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China would aim to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. China submitted its first long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in October 2021, including the target to become carbon neutral before 2060. In mid-2021, Chinese Special Climate Envoy Xie Zhenhua stated that the country's 2060 neutrality target referred to all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide (https://chinadialogue.net/en/digest/2060-neutrality-pledge-includes-all-greenhouses-gases/). 

China has been speeding up the process to tackle environmental problems since 2012. There have been 3 main sets of policy actions. The first one was announced in 2013, where the action focused on solving air pollution. The second one was announced in 2017, where the policy is on the industrial side and the capacities of heavy polluted industries such as steel manufacturing were limited. The third one was announced in 2017, where tackling pollution was listed as the 3 main ""battles"" that China will focus on during 2018-2020. These actions accumulated experience for the Chinese government to deal with environmental problems, and finally confirms its net zero timeline in Sep 2020.",https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-11/Progress%20of%20China%20NDC%202022.pdf,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,"Although the phraseology in Chinese refers only to ""carbon"" neutrality (碳中和), Chinese Special Climate Envoy Xie Zhenhua stated, in mid-2021, that the 2060 neutrality target will cover all greenhouse gas emissions, not just CO2 (https://chinadialogue.net/en/digest/2060-neutrality-pledge-includes-all-greenhouses-gases/).

Even though the production of renewable energies has increased steadily, rising energy demand within the country and the widely held belief that fossil fuels go hand in hand with economic development make it difficult to disengage from oil extraction. To restructure the national energy sector, energy governance to ensure the socio-economic sustainability is needed. Thus the social, economic, and environmental impacts must be assessed, and policies developed to meet regional needs. This means, of course, that the acceptance of renewable energies in society must be promoted through economic incentives such as new job opportunities, affordable electricity prices and accessible infrastructure. In addition, it is necessary and to limit damage to flora and fauna caused by renewable energy construction. The switch to cleaner energy sources will entail huge financial and administrative efforts to implement necessary technology, to adjust the existing energy infrastructure and to create institutions to help achieve emission reduction and energy efficiency. Efforts must be made on the national level as well as globally to achieve sustainable development in countries that are trying to balance resource rent dependencies, increasing energy demand, as well as achieving a national energy transition. Global energy policies could consider the needs of these countries and help improve, rather than worsen, already unequal power relations. Combating climate change should be the most important goal on the global agenda, meaning that new policy paths are required which prioritize international cooperation instead of international power struggles. The future should feature new approaches similar to the Yasuní-ITT initiative in Ecuador, which sought international payments for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, thus preserving biodiversity and globally important oxygen sources. Ecuador, like other countries dependent on fossil fuels or coal, must be supported in their quest for clean energy. Without international support, the nations’ access to a green future will be thwarted, aggravating climate change.

In the baseline scenario, it is thought that around 5 MtCO2 in industry per year could be avoided by 2050, and that about 10 MtCO2 of negative emissions could be produced annually thanks to the BECCS. Following the adaptation of the European CCS Directive in 2009, the legislative framework is ready. The use of BECCS will require an adequately centralized use of biomass (in fixed facilities and therefore excluding transport), whereas bio-energy generally is more often used in small facilities in a more scattered way. Rolling out these technologies will benefit from proper integration with the regions’ economies, ideally reusing existing infrastructure and underground storage, offshore if necessary.
Uncertainties regarding these technologies, their acceptability and the availability and reliability of storage mean that their development must be carefully considered and based on the definition of a viable economic model combined with good long-term risk management. That being said, it is most likely that it is an essential option for the future, as it allows for the generation of continuous negative emissions over the very long term (with forest storage eventually reaching an optimum level, draining carbon sinks in a few decades/centuries). Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also an option, but it is still in the very early stages of research and development.",['Climate Ambition Alliance'],3050122936380.8,,64531444,,,,,352100000,2019,,

The amount of greenhouse gas removal or emissions possible from the UK’s natural environment is dependent on how the UK uses its land and the land’s condition. In 2017, an estimated 28 million tonnes of CO2 and other carbon gases were removed by vegetation in the UK3.

However, potential GHG emissions from some areas of the UK’s natural environment that are not in good condition are currently excluded from the definition.

Guyana is also prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership
Agreement (VPA) under EU- FLEGT. The VPA is expected to be finalized in 2016 and to
provide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices
throughout Guyana‟s timber industry.
We are prepared to improve added- value activities locally to assist in creating a
higher potential for carbon storage in long-use wood products. This could also
potentially reduce the pressure on forest resources as derivation of a higher value
may result in reduced harvest levels.
Indigenous people own and manage some 14% of Guyana‟s lands. The culture and
traditions of Guyana‟s indigenous peoples are rooted in sustainable use of nature,
evident in the forests and other natural ecosystems maintained through centuries on
the lands they have customarily occupied and used. Guyana will strengthen its
support for indigenous communities as they continue the stewardship of their lands
and inter alia the benefits that accrue from any REDD+ activities from these lands.
If they choose to, communities will be supported to better manage their transition to
more market-based means of provisioning for their social and cultural well-being in
ways that continue the tradition of wise use. Indigenous peoples themselves, through
the full application of the FPIC process, in keeping with the stated policy in the
LCDS, will decide whether or not to include their titled lands as part of Guyana‟s
REDD+ programme. Policies will also be implemented to reflect equity between the
extractive sector and indigenous peoples as the nation moves to genuinely ensure
that the fight against climate change continues.
ii) Conditional Contributions
Avoided Deforestation
Guyana‟s proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined
Reference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as
concluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana‟s historic emissions level
for the period 2000 to 2009 (0.06%) as established in the GNA. Using a total carbon
stock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 tCO2e,
Guyana‟s Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7 MtCO2e. Through
this approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 MtCO2e
annually if adequate incentives are provided.
8
To contribute to avoided deforestation and achieve an effective REDD+ programme,
Guyana will implement policies measures, and incentive programmes, to engender
broader participation of civil society and the private sector in actions to avoid
deforestation and forest degradation. The Guyana Government is cognizant of the need
for comprehensive land use planning in order to efficiently management and rationally
exploit our national resources.
In summary, avoided emissions contributions resulting from reforms in the timber and
mining industries can contribute up to 48.7 MtCO2e to the global mitigation effort
through the implementation of the Emission Reduction Programme described in greater
detail below.
Emission Reduction Programme for Forests
Given that the bulk of Guyana‟s emissions emanate from mining and logging activities,
our Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP) will therefore focus on making these
industries more efficient and compliant with our targets. With adequate resources,
Guyana will develop a suite of ERP measures that will include:
- the conservation of an additional 2 million hectares through Guyana‟s
National Protected Area System and other effective area -based conservation
measures as per Guyana‟s commitment under the UNCBD, including the
protection of conservancies and reservoirs and their watersheds and the
watersheds upstream of new hydro-power sites. Existing mangrove forests
will be counted in this target and the mangrove restoration programme along
the vulnerable coast will be expanded.
Timber harvesting contributed 40% of Guyana‟s emissions from land use between
2001 and 2012. In the timber industry the ERP will:
• Use of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and
collateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid
trails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the
annual emissions by 13.5%. This translates to a reduction of about 430,000
tCO2 per year.
This will result in a reduction of the annual emissions from the timber industry
from 3.5M tCO2 to 2.3M tCO2, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this
driver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level.
• Guyana is in the process of reviewing compliance of significant timber
concession agreements with a view to determining if they meet agreed targets. 
9
A wider review to determine the most optimal use of these lands will be
undertaken. If, in fact, REDD+ can provide adequate incentives, Guyana would
be prepared to reduce the area to be logged in favour of conservation
concessions and to further the development of non-timber forest products and
other forest-based services while recognizing the need for livelihoods.
Our MRVS has verified that small scale gold mining resulted in 89% of the deforestation
recorded in Guyana over the past three years. To address this, the ERP will include
actions by the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) to implement policy
reforms, education, and incentives for integrated planning and management of the
mining sector. This will support the transformation of the mining sector by 2020 and
include actions to:
• Implement mineral mapping in the mining districts to identify
economically exploitable deposits. This will significantly reduce deforestation
by avoiding clearing of forest cover from lands which contain only marginal
mineral deposits. A significant portion of Guyana‟s deforestation results from
forest clearing for mining that does not generate a profit.
• Implement awareness and incentive programmes to improve the
efficiency of technologies and practices in the mining industry. This will
include replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient
technologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase
gold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause
miners to often return to previously mined areas when technology or
economic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency
would make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate costeffective reforestation and recovery of mined sites.
• Implement policies to institute mandatory, nation-wide land
reclamation and reforestation of mined areas.

Forest Governance
Guyana has made significant progress in complying with EU-FLEGT for our timber
exports to the European Union. Additional resources are required to build institutional
and private sector capacity to meet other trade and supply conditions such as the Lacey
Act, FSC certification and other procurement requirements.
MRVS
A comprehensive and robust MRV system, one of the most advanced of its kind, has
been developed under Guyana‟s REDD+ programme. The development of this system
has contributed considerably to the global understanding of how small forested tropical
countries can reliably and cost-effectively measure and report on its forest carbon 
10
emissions. Guyana is willing to build on the lessons learnt thus far to complete and
maintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided to do so.
Implementation cost
The cost of implementation of these forest-conservation initiatives in total is estimated
to be determined annually.
Energy
Unconditional Contributions
Guyana is in the process of reviewing our options toward the rapid expansion of a
renewable energy supply. Our goal is to develop a mix of wind, solar, biomass and
hydropower to supply both the demand of the national grid and the energy
requirements for towns and villages in Guyana‟s hinterland.
Guyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems
at suitable locations such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari. Guyana will power all
of the six newly established townships, starting with Bartica, using renewable energy
sources. Currently, Guyana has installed cogeneration from bagasse to power sugar
mills. Independent power producers and suppliers are being encouraged to construct
energy farms and sell energy to the national grid. Preliminary approvals have been given
for a 26MW wind farm.
The Government of Guyana will continue to work closely with farmers in agricultural
areas across Guyana to encourage the use of bio-digesters to reduce waste, produce
biogas and provide affordable, healthy and efficient cooking means at the household
level.
Legislation has been enacted to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation
of renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to
incentivize and motivate energy efficient behavior. Guyana will continue to conduct
energy audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, residential and commercial
buildings to reduce energy consumption. Public education and awareness programmes
will continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools to
reduce energy consumption and expenditure. Guyana will implement other policies to
encourage energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, including building codes
and net-metering of residential renewable power.
We expect that these unconditional contributions will significantly reduce Guyana‟s
energy consumption.
Conditional Contributions
Guyana is committed to eliminating our near complete dependence on fossil fuels.
Given our solar, wind and hydropower potential and relatively small national demand, 
11
we believe that with adequate and timely financial support, Guyana can develop a 100%
renewable power supply by 2025. Assessment of the potential of the renewable power
sources will be undertaken to determine the most cost effective and efficient means of
developing this potential; to this end an independent review of the Amaila Falls Project
is to be undertaken with the assistance of the Kingdom of Norway.","Other URLs

-30% decrease, respectively, compared with 2005.

While the target for ETS sectors is set at European level, as it is a system applied to all Member States on a harmonised and centralised basis, the target of reducing greenhouse gases relating to sectors falling under the Effort Sharing Regulation is split between the various Member States.

Togo's greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 (baseline year) represented just 0.05% of total emissions worldwide. 
Togo commits to limit temperature rise to 2°C by 2030. Togo implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the energy, agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. 

In terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in Togo by 20% over the course of the period under review, by improving the road system, promoting the use of public transport, reducing the average age of imported vehicles (to 5-7 years) and promoting active modes of transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths).

Equity:
Togo is a small country that emits almost no GHGs and so has virtually no responsibility in terms of global warming. Through its INDC, Togo proposes to focus on carbon-lean sustainable development, by encouraging sustainable practices, whereas the easy solution would simply be to continue using fossil fuels while they are still available.
According to the IPCC, the estimated worldwide GHG emissions for 2010 totalled roughly 40,000 Mt of CO2e. The emissions from the Republic of Togo for the same year were estimated at 20.45 Mt of CO2e, representing about 0.05% of the total volume. The emissions are non-significant compared with worldwide emissions.

The Inflation Reduction Act covers the appropriation of funds and the implementation of charges. 

60 bn dollars are earmarked for funding for ""environmental justice priorities""
Among the funding streams available under the act are $3bn in “environmental and climate justice block grants”, which local governments, Native American tribes and community groups can access to tackle environmental issues in their areas.
Additionally, some funds are appropriated to, among other things, help eligible recipients develop  ""qualified climate action plans"", which include ""a strategy to collaborate with, communicate with, and address potential effects on low-income and disadvantaged near-port communities and other stakeholders that may be affected by implementation of the plan;"" (page 666)

Some funding is appropriated to various federal bodies in order to facilitate ""timely and efficient environmental reviews and authorizations"" However, no schedule is determined.

Democratic senators have quoted the possibility for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline), with the Rhodium group giving similar estimates of 32%-42%, Energy Innovation 37-41%, and 42% according to the REPEAT project based at Princeton University. The climate action tracker estimates a wider potential range of emissions cut
 by 2030 (26 to 42% relative to 2005 levels). bHence, although expected emissions reductions are not included within the actual target plan, this represents a real and tangible impact on future emissions.

Equity statement - ""As a developing country, in line with the principles of equity, as well as common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, our ability to respond to climate change is likely to be far slower than our developed world counterparts. In view of this latter point, we would like to reiterate that effective responses to climate change can be accomplished with appropriate financial, technological, and capacity-building support from the developed world in line with their corresponding obligations to provide such support. South Africa received in excess of 4 billion US dollars in financial support from bilateral and multilateral sources towards climate change action. It is worth noting, with concern, that the majority of reported financial climate support has not been in the form of grants, but mostly in the form of loans. Be that as it may, South Africa remains committed to doing its best to combat climate change through various measures, drawing on the much appreciated capacity-building, technical and financial support of developed countries.""

In the updated NDC report- Carbon capture and storage – CO2 compression, hub transport and storage under $20/t of CO2 as well as soil carbon measurements under $3/ha/year
""Carbon capture and storage: The $20 per tonne of CO₂ stretch goal covers CO2 compression, hub transport and storage, but does not cover capture processes, noting the cost of capture technologies varies between applications and depends on factors such as the relative concentration of CO2 for different industrial processes. The stretch goal assumes CO₂ is transported within a hub distance of less than 100 km to suitable reservoirs. Achieving a stretch goal of under $20 per tonne would position CCS to be competitive over the long term with other forms of abatement supported by Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. Under a high technology scenario, CCS could be deployed as early as 2025, subject to securing offtake agreements and development approvals.""

soil carbon- ""Soil carbon measurement: The soil carbon measurement stretch goal time range was set based on consultations with industry. Based on a high technology uptake scenario, advancements in proximal sensing, simulation modelling and remote sensing technologies could see the stretch goal of under $3 per hectare per year reached as early as 2025. As of 2020, soil carbon measurement for Emissions Reduction Fund projects were estimated at around $30 per hectare per year (CSIRO estimates based on a land area of 300 hectares; estimates could be lower for larger areas).""

""Achievement of Australia’s priority technology stretch goals will have a significant impact on global emissions. The five technologies first identified in Australia’s first low emissions technology statement (2020) (hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions materials, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement) address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually. Australia is targeting international partnerships that support these economic stretch goals, including access to global markets and more competitive supply chains. We are also prioritising partnerships that focus on critical research, development and deployment challenges for economically important, hard-to-abate sectors."" 

so as mentioned above, there is a strong emphasis on technology stretch goals to have an impact on global emissions.

This will ensure our policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international developments and other factors. It will ensure there is transparency regarding how progress is tracked, including any updates or revisions, achievements and effectiveness of key national policies and investments, as well as the role of state and territory policies and targets in contributing to the national goal.

",,"The primary focus of the NDC is the adaptation component. 
The NDC is conditional; the fulfilment of the NDC is dependent on international financing
The main areas of focus for mitigation emission reduction are:
1. Electricity - 33% reduction 
2. Oil and gas - 65%
3. Transport - 7%
The key for Egypt to mitigate GHGs emissions is to provide appropriate foundations for
the development of low carbon energy systems.
Pathways to achieving high CO2 mitigation levels comprise the following:
 Widespread diffusion of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy production
technologies, with substantial reductions in energy intensity
 Comprehensive mitigation efforts covering all major sources of emissions
 Locally-appropriate technology transfer and financial flows from industrialized
countries (Annex I countries) to support carbon emission abatement according
to the UNFCCC principles, which acknowledges that developed countries should
provide required support to developing countries in this regard.
Policies targeting development that is more sustainable rely upon five main pillars:
1. More efficient use of energy, especially by end users;
2. Increased use of renewable energy as an alternative to non-renewable energy
sources;
3. Use of advanced locally-appropriate and more-efficient fossil fuel technologies,
which is less-emitting, in addition to new generations of nuclear power;
4. Energy efficiency is the cornerstone to be targeted by policy makers to decouple
demand on energy and economic growth; and
5. Reform energy subsidies. This policy is implemented using four pillars, namely:
set different prices for petroleum products based on energy generation
efficiency; increase the efficiency of energy use; provide support to certain
sectors to promote switching from conventional energy sources to clean energy
sources; and apply the fuel subsidy smartcard system to ensure that subsidies
are received by target beneficiaries.
The degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one
of the main distinguishing characteristics of greenhouse gas reduction pathways.
Energy efficiency could be improved radically through a combination of behavioral
changes and rapid introduction of stringent efficiency regulations, technology
standards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.
Renewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very
important role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate
change manageable. However, renewable energy may provide a number of
opportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development,
energy access, secure energy supply, and reduced local environmental and health
impacts. ",https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-07/Egypt%20Updated%20NDC.pdf.pdf,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,Not Specified,Yes,Not Specified,,,,No,"Aviation - aim to green the sector by introducing 2% biofuels to airplanes, improve energy efficiency of facilities

Unlike Israel's original NDC, this new Decision includes an unconditional absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal for 2030 of 27% relative to 2015 and an unconditional absolute GHG emissions reduction goal for 2050 of 85% relative to 2015. 
Whereas our INDC submitted in 2015 projected 2030 emissions would be 81.65 MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to be 58 MtCO2e by 2030.
This updated goal significantly improves upon Israel's first NDC which was presented as a per capita economy-wide unconditional GHG reduction. The previous target was 7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which corresponded to a total of 81.6 MtCO2e. The updated target presented in this NDC is 58 MtCO2e, which corresponds to a reduction of 23 MtCO2e or 29% in Israel' s total emissions. 
We believe that this updated NDC is a marked improvement both in the process by which the 2030 and 2050 national and sectoral goals were determined; in the more ambitious mitigation goal and in the work carried out to increase preparedness and adaptation to Climate Change.

Nigeria has updated its NDC targets to 47% conditional cut in GHG emissions by 2030, on the 27th of May, 2021. Its previous conditional target was 45% by 2030. The conditions being that Nigeria would need much international support.  It otherwise, has pledged to reduce its GHG emissions by 20%, (using 2018 as baseline year) by 2030. According to the International Energy Association, Nigeria emitted 104.27 MtCO2e in 2018. 2018 MtCO2e levels represents an increase of 271.6% from 1990 levels.  Between 2010 and 2018, Nigeria’s GHG emissions increased by 40% to reach 347 MtCO2eq.

The variations in the trend are due to the increase in international traffic within the country. Emissions from international shipping totaled 13,490.0 kt CO2 eq, increasing by 63.6% since 2009, mainly due to the increase in flow from the expansion of the Panama Canal.

The country will carry out indirect actions that may contribute to improving the quality of manure management, for example, improving the Nex by applying a specific TAM for the animals.

Inventory improvement plan for the land use, land-use change, and forestry sector: (1) Collect data on geospatial activity from year to year, so that emissions are not underestimated or removals are overestimated and (2) Promote the inclusion of estimates of emissions and removals of harvested wood products. At the moment, there is no defined roadmap for its implementation.

Plan to estimate the emissions generated by nitrogen from agricultural residues returned to soils and the product emissions of mineralized nitrogen resulting from the loss in the organic carbon stock of mineral soils.

Inventory improvement plan for the waste sector: Implement a registration system for volumes entering waste disposal sites nationwide.

The Ministry of the Environment is responsible, together with the support of other institutions, to publish national inventories of emissions by ""sources and removals by sink of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol"" on a regular basis, which includes biennial update reports as part of national commitments to the UNFCCC. Panama regulates Chapter II of Title V of the Texto Único de la Ley No. 41 of 1998, through Executive Decree No. 100 of October 2020, which will govern the preparation of inventories by sources and removals by carbon sink.

There was an increase in the net absorptions of CO2 that changed the country's GHG emissions and removals profile, going from a purely emitting country to a sink country from 1994 to 2013.

The results of the 2020 National Inventories Report of greenhouse gases from 1994 to 2017 categorise Panama as a carbon sink country. National emissions are offset by the forest cover in the national territory due to the annual increase in the carbon stocks of secondary forests.
